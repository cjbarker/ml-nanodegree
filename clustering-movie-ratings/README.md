# K-Means Clustering of Movie Ratings

## The Problem
Say you're a data analyst at Netflix and you want to explore the similarities and differences in people's tastes in movies based on how they rate different movies. Can understanding these ratings contribute to a movie recommendation system for users? Let's dig into the data and see.

The data we'll be using comes from the wonderful [MovieLens user rating dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). We'll be looking at individual movie ratings later in the notebook, but let us start with how ratings of genres compare to each other.

## Setup
Install necessary library dependencies first.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run via Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook kmeans_movie_ratings.ipynb
```
